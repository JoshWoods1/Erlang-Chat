# Overview

I developed a chat application using Erlang to demonstrate my understanding of the language syntax and concepts. The software allows multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real-time via a text-based interface.

My purpose for writing this software was to deepen my knowledge of concurrent programming and distributed systems, both of which are fundamental concepts in Erlang. By building a chat application, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with message passing, process spawning, and socket communication in Erlang.

# Development Environment

- Erlang Language
- VS Code

# Useful Websites

* [Erlang Documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/)
* [Zorched](https://www.zorched.net/2008/05/29/erlang-examples-talk-with-sockets/)

# Future Work

*It doesn't exactly work 100% right now but I plan to make it so that you can see messages from the client side.
