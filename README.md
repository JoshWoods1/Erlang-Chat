# Overview


Overview
I developed a chat application using Erlang to demonstrate my understanding of the language syntax and concepts. The software allows multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real-time via a text-based interface.

My purpose for writing this software was to deepen my knowledge of concurrent programming and distributed systems, both of which are fundamental concepts in Erlang. By building a chat application, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with message passing, process spawning, and socket communication in Erlang.
